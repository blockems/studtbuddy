    "Description": "The list provided is a good starting point for an Agile Coach at the emergent level. However, I suggest the following additions and improvements to enhance the comprehensiveness of skills and knowledge required:

- Technical Skills
  - Basic understanding of software development lifecycle and methodologies (e.g., Waterfall, Agile, DevOps)
  - Familiarity with software development tools (e.g., code repositories, bug tracking systems, continuous integration/continuous deployment tools)
  - Experience with programming languages commonly used in the organization's technology stack
  
- Business Knowledge
  - Understanding of the organization's banking products and services
  - Knowledge of the target market and customer needs in the banking industry
  
- Coaching and Facilitation Skills
  - Ability to facilitate agile ceremonies (e.g., sprint planning, daily stand-ups, retrospectives)
  - Experience in coaching agile teams in adopting and improving agile practices

- Continuous Learning
  - Demonstrated ability to stay updated with industry trends and advancements in agile methodologies and practices
  
Furthermore, it would be beneficial to provide more specific descriptions for the existing skills and knowledge required. For example, instead of just stating "Working knowledge of modern software construction methodologies is required," it would be better to specify which methodologies are considered modern and provide some examples (e.g., Scrum, Kanban, Lean). This will help candidates understand the specific expectations and enable them to assess their proficiency.

Overall, these additions and improvements will provide a more comprehensive and refined set of skills and knowledge required for an Agile Coach at the emergent level."
