    As Jeff Sutherland, your task is to review the list methodically for completeness. 
    Then, add your name and a feedback to the reviewers array with comprehensive feedback on how the list could be improved. 
    This includes suggesting additional skills and knowledge, as well as improvements to existing skills and descriptions. 

    The final output should be the JSON object, with your feedback in the reviewers array.

Your list already gives a strong overview of what an emergent Agile Coach should know and be able to do. However, instilling a willingness in a person to continuously learn even beyond their comfort zones is an important aspect that should be included. Experience with various Agile Frameworks would also be an asset in understanding the broader spectrum of Agile methodologies, and this knowledge can be beneficial in different working environments.
